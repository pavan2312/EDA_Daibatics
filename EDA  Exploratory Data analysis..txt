Some examples of advanced SQL topics include:

Joins: Understanding and using different types of joins (e.g., inner join, left join, right join, etc.) to combine data from multiple tables.

Subqueries: Using subqueries to perform calculations or filter data before joining or selecting it.

Window functions: Using window functions to perform calculations over a set of rows, such as calculating running totals or ranking results.

Indexing: Understanding how indexing works and how to create and use indexes to improve query performance.

Performance tuning: Understanding how to optimize SQL queries for performance, such as by reducing the number of queries, using the appropriate data types, or using stored procedures.

Complex data types: Understanding and working with complex data types, such as arrays, JSON, and XML.

Stored procedures: Understanding how to write and use stored procedures to encapsulate complex logic and improve performance.

Overall, advanced SQL skills require a deep understanding of database design principles and a strong familiarity with the SQL language and its advanced features.
